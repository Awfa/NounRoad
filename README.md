# Noun Rush
Welcome to Noun Rush: a game based on the words you know. At the start of the game, both players must enter their name and the first player will start by entering a noun. The last letter of Player 1's word will be Player 2's first letter, meaning they have to think of a word that starts with that letter. The process continues with each player going back and forth thinking of words that begin with the previous word's last letter.

- Nouns cannot be repeated and you only have a certain amount of time! - Players gain one strike for each time they cannot think of a word. Three strikes and you're out!
- Shift + Backspace erases the entire line in the text entry box.
- Typing in "CodeDayWinningFeature" at the winner's screen resets the game back to the beginning where you enter the players' names.
